Liliane Correia Review
Comments:
- Perhaps a reduction of the code presented in "handleArgs" method should be considered, providing only a snippet of it to illustrate the issue.
- The overall report is concise in demonstrating the code smells present in the program
- The analysis was well-done and even included solutions for the identified code smells.
