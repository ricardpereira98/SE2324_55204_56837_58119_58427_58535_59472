Review (08/11/2023 - Diogo Lemos):
    There may be more classes than what is required in the first pattern (Template Method) diagram,
    but it seems to be correctly identified.
    While the inheritance does enable the possibility of having more than one implementation per method,
    I believe the pattern identified might not be the most accurate one, since the object's behaviour doesnt
    really change dinamically.
    The third pattern (Factory Method) seems to be correctly identified.
