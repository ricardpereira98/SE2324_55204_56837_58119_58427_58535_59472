Comment: The comprehensive explanation of dependency metrics in the field of software engineering is both informative and insightful. It effectively dissects various metrics, including cyclic dependency, Dcy, Dcy*, Dpt, Dpt*, PDcy, PDpt, and PDpt*, providing a clear understanding of their significance and practical applications.

The incorporation of practical examples and scenarios, alongside the note on calculating average values, enhances the depth and real-world applicability of the discussion. This enables readers to not only comprehend the metrics' theoretical aspects but also to envision their practical use within their own software projects.

The organization of the content is commendable, with each metric succinctly explained and presented in a logical order. Furthermore, the suggestion to leverage design patterns like Factory or Adapter to address high dependencies is a pragmatic approach to resolving potential issues. This practical perspective is valuable for software developers and engineers seeking to improve the maintainability and efficiency of their software systems.
