The detailed explanation of dependency metrics in software engineering provides a comprehensive and insightful overview of an essential aspect of software development. The text effectively breaks down various metrics, such as cyclic dependency, Dcy, Dcy*, Dpt, Dpt*, PDcy, PDpt, and PDpt*, offering a clear understanding of their significance and applications.

The inclusion of practical examples and scenarios, as well as the note about calculating average values, adds depth and practicality to the discussion. This allows readers to grasp the real-world implications of these metrics and how they can be applied in their own software projects.is well-structured, with each metric explained concisely and in a logical order. Additionally, the note about using design patterns like Factory or Adapter to address high dependencies shows a practical approach to mitigating potential issues.
