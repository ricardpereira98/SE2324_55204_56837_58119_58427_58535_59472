Comment: The assessment provides valuable insights into the codebase. The observation that the LootSession class may be categorized as a "Data Class" is accurate. This classification highlights that the class primarily holds data without significant functionality, which can lead to a more streamlined and efficient design.

Similarly, the recognition of a "Long Method" issue in the main method of ForestMaker.java is crucial. Long methods can indeed introduce challenges in code maintenance and comprehension, ultimately affecting the overall code quality. The recommendation to address this issue through code refactoring aligns with best practices for code organization and readability.
