The lily´s  project correctly points out that the LootSession class appears to be a "Data Class," which mainly contains data without real functionality.The lily´s project rightly identifies a "Long Method" issue in the main method of ForestMaker.java.

In summary, the code review effectively identifies areas for improvement in terms of code structure, length, and relevance.
