Reviewer: Reviewed by José Pereira:

The first design pattern appears to be correctly assigned as a Factory Design Pattern, since we have a generic interface from which its subclasses redefine the object, in this case the unit’s location, each subclass manages its object (location) independently from the other subclasses.

The second design pattern also seems to be correctly identified as a Template Method, since we have an abstract class that defines a general skeleton and then we specify the “algorithm”, in this case a particular Nation in each subclass.

The third and last pattern, is also correctly identified as a Singleton since we have a private constructor implying that the class can only be instantiated by itself.
