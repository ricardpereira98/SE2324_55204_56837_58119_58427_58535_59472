Comments:

- The report includes code snippets and UML diagrams, making it easier to compehend the design pattern being demonstrated

- It might beneficial to double-check some of the patterns to ensure accuracy. Fro example: oe of the pattern appears to be more closely related to Factory Design pattern than the Command pattern.

- Nonetheless, the explanations of the patterns are clear and comprehensible
