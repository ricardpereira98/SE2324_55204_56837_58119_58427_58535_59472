Review (08/11/2023 - Diogo Lemos):
    The first pattern seems to be correctly identified. It is a good example of Magic Numbers,
    since it does compromise the readability of the method.
    The second pattern seems to be correctly identified and the explanation behind it seems
    very accurate.
    It is true that it is a bad pratice to keep that many characters grouped together without much
    context other than comments, especially repeated ones, I dont believe Data Clump to be the most
    accurate Code Pattern in this situation, since it usually applies to a group of data that would
    rather be together inside its own class to be used as a single instance.
