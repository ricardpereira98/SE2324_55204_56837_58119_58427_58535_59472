I'm not sure if the arrows direction is correct. I would need help from another person to check on it.
The Doc has some information that was not ask by the teachers but it's a nice addition, like the pre/post condition and main/alternative flow.
I like how you divided the Use Cases in different subjects. 
Overall the it seems to be ok.
