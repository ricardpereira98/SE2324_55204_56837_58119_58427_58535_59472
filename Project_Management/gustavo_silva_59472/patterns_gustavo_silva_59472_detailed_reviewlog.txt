It's worth noting that the design patterns utilized in the codebase appear to have been well chosen for their respective contexts.

The Singleton Pattern, as applied in FSGConverter.java, effectively embodies the essential characteristics of a Singleton, ensuring a single instance with private constructor, synchronized access, and global access point.
The Factory Pattern, exemplified by ResourceFactory.java, is a suitable choice for creating Resource objects based on parameters, offering a structured and flexible approach while simplifying resource management.
The Template Pattern, employed in Resource.java and its eight implementations, provides a clear and effective way to establish a common structure and make necessary method adjustments, promoting code reuse and consistency.
Overall, the use of these design patterns appears to be well-matched with the specific requirements and objectives of the respective classes.
