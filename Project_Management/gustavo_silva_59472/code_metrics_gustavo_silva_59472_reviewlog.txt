REVIEWER - Jos√© Trigueiro 58119:

The document seems to be well-structured and informative. It provides a detailed explanation of the Chidamber-Kemerer metrics, including Coupling Between Objects (CBO), Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT), Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM), Number of Children (NOC), Response For a Class (RFC), and Weighted Methods per Class (WMC). Each metric is explained with its definition, data considerations, and an analysis of its application.
The graphs help alot visualizing the data and it's a nice adition.
Overall it seems to be ok, except the page 6 that has a minor formation problem with the text "Interface" leaving the word page.
